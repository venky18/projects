Usually when first time users land on coala website, they want to know how
to install it, run it, get the results as soon as possible.
It'd be helpful if the website offers a bear search mechanism.
Users can search bears and filter the search results on basis of language,
its ability to detect and fix code problems and more such parameters.
Furthermore the website can show analytics related to Bears like, the most
popular bears, recently created bears.
The contributors and community are an essential part of coala.
The website can show coala activity of contributors in an interactive manner,
like having a dashboard type view showing data of each contributor.

Lots of amazing things happen in coala at the same time.
This project also aims to develop the coala blog and push it towards becoming
a platform to share these stories.
A better designed platform in terms of user interface and experience.

We currently have coala-html to view coala analysis results in the browser
in a beautiful format, out of CLI world.
But some of its components require user interaction with CLI, for eg: starting
up coala-html requires `coala-html -h`.
If coala-html is converted to a cross platform desktop application using
frameworks such as Electron, we can have a CLI independent tool.

The Sublime Text package control page could be used as inspiration for a
bear page: <https://packagecontrol.io/>
